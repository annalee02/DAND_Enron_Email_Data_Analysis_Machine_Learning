## Project Overview
In this project, I played detective, and put my machine learning skills to use by building an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

### Why this Project?
This project taught me the end-to-end process of investigating data through a machine learning lens.  
It guided me how to extract and identify useful features that best represent the data, a few of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms today, and how to evaluate the performance of my machine learning algorithms. 

### What will I learn?
By the end of the project, I will be able to:
* Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset
* Validate a machine learning result using test data
* Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics
* Create, select and transform features
* Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms
* Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance
* Communicate my machine learning algorithm results clearly

## Data Overview
In 2000, Enron was one of the largest companies in the United States. By 2002, it had collapsed into bankruptcy due to widespread corporate fraud. In the resulting Federal investigation, a significant amount of typically confidential information entered into the public record, including tens of thousands of emails and detailed financial data for top executives. In this project, I built a person of interest identifier based on financial and email data made public as a result of the Enron scandal.
